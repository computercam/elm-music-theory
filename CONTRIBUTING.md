# Contributing to this project

Welcome! Thanks for your interest in `elm-music-theory`.

If you have a question about this project, feel free to reach out to me at `@duncan` on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/).

## No design contributions please (for now)

I'm currently working on the design of this project myself and am not accepting contributions that add features or change the design of the API. This may change in the future!

But if you're interested, please contribute in the following ways:

## Share your use cases

I'm interested in hearing about any projects you're working on that you're considering using `elm-music-theory` for, so that I can support the features you'd need if they seem relevant to the scope of this library. If you have a project you're working on, reach out to me at `@duncan` on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/) and tell me about it.

## Report issues

If you find problems or behavior that seems wrong, open an issue with a [Short, Self Contained, Correct Example](http://sscce.org/) of code that produces the problem.

Sometimes it's hard to understand a bug report out of context, so when reporting a bug, please include the following:
- What you were trying to do
- What you expected to happen and why

After we discuss the bug and agree on the correct behavior and possible API changes, I'm open to PRs that would address the issues. But it's always a great move to start a conversation first.

## Share your theory knowledge

Apart from independent study of piano, jazz theory, and basic arrangement, I consider myself an amateur musician. If you have experience at the university level or as a practicing composer or performer, I am interested in what you have to say about how I have approached the ideas from these fields.
