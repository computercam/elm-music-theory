# A toolkit for musical ideas

This library provides tools for working with musical concepts like notes, chords, rhythms, etc., with the goal of making it easier to write, arrange, analyze, and programmatically generate music in the [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) language.

## Current status: alpha

This project's public API is subject to change, and it is not yet published to the [Elm community packages](https://package.elm-lang.org/). *Don't rely on it for production code!* I do plan to publish it once the API is stable enough for a first release.

## Documentation

You can learn more about this project, its goals, and my current approach in this [Gitbook](https://duncanmalashock.gitbook.io/music-theory/) (a work in progress).
