# elm-music-theory

## A toolkit for musical ideas

This package allows you to work with musical concepts like pitches, intervals, chords, keys, and scales. Use it to:
- Explore and understand musical relationships
- Develop music applications
- Solve musical problems like [harmonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonization), [sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_%28music%29), and [counterpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint)
- Generate music procedurally

## Current status: alpha

This API is preliminary and subject to change. Don't depend on it for your production software.

### Gitbook

This project has a [Gitbook](https://duncanmalashock.gitbook.io/music-theory/), which attempts to explain not only the concepts of music theory, but also how they've been modeled here and why.
