# Voicing methods


## Jazz

These methods have been used to harmonize brass and saxophone sections since the 1930s (and maybe even earlier), but they are very versatile!

Note: jazz voicing methods can involve substitutions of related chords with the same function, so don't be surprised when you see voicings that include a pitch class that isn't strictly in the chord you specified.

These methods were adapted from [Jazz Arranging Techniques](http://lindsayjazz.com/jazz-arranging-techniques/) by Gary Lindsay.

## Classical

Note: these classical methods were developed before jazz harmony, and so chord extensions and added tones will not be included.

{-| Voice a chord using the "four-way close" method:

    Chord.voiceFourParts
        { voiceOne = Range.sopranoVoice
        , voiceTwo = Range.altoVoice
        , voiceThree = Range.tenorVoice

        == [ "C4, B3, G3, E3"
           , -- 39 others...
           ]

This method voices all four notes "closely" within the span of an octave.

-}
close : VoicingMethod
close =
    FourPartJazz.close


{-| Voice a chord using the "four-way drop-2" method:

    Chord.voiceFourParts
        { voiceOne = Range.sopranoVoice
        , voiceTwo = Range.altoVoice
        , voiceThree = Range.tenorVoice
        , voiceFour = Range.bassVoice
        }

        == [ "C4, G3, E3, B2"
           , -- 55 others...
           ]

This method is the same as four-way close, but with the second pitch from the top dropped by an octave for a wider, semi-open sound.

-}
drop2 : VoicingMethod
drop2 =
    FourPartJazz.drop2


{-| Voice a chord using the "four-way drop-2-and-4" method:

    Chord.voiceFourParts
        { voiceOne = Range.sopranoVoice
        , voiceTwo = Range.altoVoice
        , voiceThree = Range.tenorVoice
        , voiceFour = Range.bassVoice
        }
        [ drop2and4 ]
        (Chord.majorSeventh PitchClass.c)
        |> List.map toString
        == [ "G4, C4, E3, B2"
           , -- 55 others...
           ]

A double drop voicing, with the second and fourth pitches from the top dropped for a wide, open sound.

-}
drop2and4 : VoicingMethod
drop2and4 =
    FourPartJazz.drop2and4


{-| Voice a chord using the "four-way drop-3" method:

    Chord.voiceFourParts
        { voiceOne = Range.sopranoVoice
        , voiceTwo = Range.altoVoice
        , voiceThree = Range.tenorVoice
        , voiceFour = Range.bassVoice
        }
        [ drop3 ]
        (Chord.majorSeventh PitchClass.c)
        |> List.map toString
        == [ "C4, G3, E3, B2"
           , -- 55 others...
           ]

Same as drop-2, but with the third pitch from the top dropped instead of the second.

-}
drop3 : VoicingMethod
drop3 =
    FourPartJazz.drop3


{-| Voice a chord using the "four-way spread" method:

    Chord.voiceFourParts
        { voiceOne = Range.sopranoVoice
        , voiceTwo = Range.altoVoice
        , voiceThree = Range.tenorVoice
        , voiceFour = Range.bassVoice
        }
        [ spread ]
        (Chord.majorSeventh PitchClass.c)
        |> List.map toString
        == [ "C4, B3, E3, G2"
           , -- 22 others...
           ]

Another open voicing method, with the root of the chord on the bottom for a dramatic effect.

spread =
    FourPartJazz.spread


{-| Voice a chord in "root position":

    Chord.voiceFourParts
        { voiceOne = Range.sopranoVoice
        , voiceTwo = Range.altoVoice
        , voiceThree = Range.tenorVoice
        , voiceFour = Range.bassVoice
        }
        [ rootPosition ]
        (Chord.major PitchClass.c)
        |> List.map toString
        == [ "G4, E4, G3, C3"
           , -- 30 others...
           ]

A root position voicing is any voicing where the root is in the lowest voice.

rootPosition =
    FourPartClassical.rootPosition


{-| Voice a chord in "first inversion":

    Chord.voiceFourParts
        { voiceOne = Range.sopranoVoice
        , voiceTwo = Range.altoVoice
        , voiceThree = Range.tenorVoice
        , voiceFour = Range.bassVoice

        == [ "C6, C5, G4, E3"
           , -- 32 others...
           ]

A first inversion voicing is any voicing where the third of the chord is in the lowest voice.

-}
firstInversion : VoicingMethod
firstInversion =
    FourPartClassical.firstInversion


{-| Voice a chord in "second inversion":

    Chord.voiceFourParts
        { voiceOne = Range.sopranoVoice
        , voiceTwo = Range.altoVoice
        , voiceThree = Range.tenorVoice
        , voiceFour = Range.bassVoice
        }

        == [ "E4, G3, C3, G2"
           , -- 32 others...
           ]

A second inversion voicing is any voicing where the fifth of the chord is in the lowest voice.

-}
secondInversion : VoicingMethod
secondInversion =
    FourPartClassical.secondInversion


{-| Voice a chord in "third inversion":

    Chord.voiceFourParts
        { voiceOne = Range.sopranoVoice
        , voiceTwo = Range.altoVoice
        , voiceThree = Range.tenorVoice
        , voiceFour = Range.bassVoice
        }

        == [ "E4, C4, C3, Bâ™­2"
           , -- 32 others...
           ]

A third inversion voicing is any voicing where the seventh of the chord is in the lowest voice.

Note: this will return an empty list when used with triad chord types like major and minor, because a seventh must be included.
