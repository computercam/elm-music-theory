-- DEFINITION


{-| Internal representation of an unlimited raised or lowered letter.
E.g. four flats are represented as as `Offset -4`.
-}
type alias Offset =
    Internal.Offset


{-| Opaque type that represents a pitch class.
-}
type alias PitchClass =
    Internal.PitchClass

{-| Create a pitch class from a letter and an accidental.

-- ACCESSORS


{-| A list of all pitch classes that with at most 3 accidentals.
`Cbbb, Cbb, Cb, C, C#, C##, C###, Dbbb, Dbb, ...`.
-}

-- TRANSFORM


{-| Number of semitones between C natural and a given pitch class.

    semitones (pitchClass E natural) == 4

-}
semitones : PitchClass -> Int
semitones =
    Internal.semitones


toString : PitchClass -> String
toString pc =
    Internal.toString (Enharmonic.simple pc)



-- TRANSPOSE


{-| Moves a pitch class up by a given interval while taking the correct
number off staff positions between root and target pitch class into account.
-}
transposeUp : Interval -> PitchClass -> PitchClass
transposeUp =
    Internal.transposeUp


{-| Moves a pitch class down by a given interval while taking the correct
number off staff positions between root and target pitch class into account.

    (pitchClass B natural |> transposeDown Interval.minorSecond) == pitchClass A sharp

-}
transposeDown : Interval -> PitchClass -> PitchClass
transposeDown =
    Internal.transposeDown



-- COMPARISON


{-| Returns true if two pitch classes are enharmonic equivalent.
-}
areEnharmonicEquivalents : PitchClass -> PitchClass -> Bool
areEnharmonicEquivalents lhs rhs =
    semitones lhs == semitones rhs
